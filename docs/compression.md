Various files in Castlevania for the Nintendo 64 are compressed using a custom
form of LZ compression specific to Konami. It is commonly referred to as LZK64.

## Nisitenma-Ichigo table

The ROM contains a _magic_ 16-byte ASCII string indicating the start of a data
table with the addresses of all the compressed files.

This string is `4E69736974656E6D612D49636869676F` in hexadecimal or
`Nisitenma-Ichigo` if interpreted as ASCII characters.
